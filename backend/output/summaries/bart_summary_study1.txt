Study aimed to develop an architectural model capable of predicting the complete D fascicle architecture for primarily unipennate muscles of an arbitrary age based on fascicle data for an initial age. The model delivered good results matching interindividual dif ferences. For future studies the model could be utilized to generate realistic architectural data sets for simulation studies. Results could support Bl et als findings and showed indications for a homogeneous growth characteristic. However the model cannot be captured by simple scaling of the muscles architecite. Increases in fascicle and aponeuro sis length differ strongly during maturation. This suggests that muscle muscle architecture can change during growth suggesting that muscle growth can be affected by changes in muscle architecture. The findings could be used to generate a realistic model for simulating the growth of muscles in a simulation study. The study presents a versatile geometrical model for Dometrical muscle architecture that predicts the shape and lengths of different muscle lengths to predict its function. The most common type of zajac is a 3D object that is 3D in shape, size and shape. The shape and size of a zajAC is determined by the shape of the object. The 3D shape of an object can be determined by its size, shape,
