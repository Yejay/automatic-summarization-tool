ABSTRACT:  Nutrition and other external fac - tors are known to have a marked effect on growth of skeletal muscle, modulated, at least in part, through effects on satellite cells. Satellite cells and their embryonic precursors play an integral role in both prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle growth of mammals. Changes in maternal nu - trition can impact embryonic muscle progenitor cells which ultimately impacts both prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle development. Satellite cells are important in postnatal skeletal muscle growth as they support the hypertrophy of ex - isting myofibers. Hypertrophy of existing fi - bers is the only mechanism of postnatal muscle growth because muscle fiber number is fixed at birth and fiber nuclei have exited the cell cycle.
Because fiber nuclei do not divide, additional nu - clei required for hypertrophy must be acquired from satellite cells. To date, little research has aimed at determining whether nutrition directly impacts satellite cell populations within skeletal muscle of livestock species. However, it is well established that nutrition alters circulating con - centrations of various growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor. Each of these different growth factors impacts satellite cell proliferation and/or activation, indicating that nutrition likely plays a large role in skeletal muscle growth through impacting the satellite cell pool in both pre - natal and postnatal growth. The relationship among nutrition, growth factors, and satellite cells relative to skeletal muscle growth is an im - portant area of research that warrants further consideration.

INTRODUCTION
Skeletal muscle growth is of the utmost im - portance in the livestock industry as it becomes the marketable product, meat. It is especially im - portant to producers that their livestock grow to produce more lean product and less fat to increase overall production efficiency, while still maintain - ing a certain level of fat to ensure production of a high-quality product. Many different factors, including nutrition, genetics, and management practices, are known to impact growth of skeletal muscle in livestock species. It is well established that skeletal muscle growth occurs through a combin - ation of protein accretion, myonuclear accretion,
Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue and grows through several different mechanisms, making de - termination of how these different factors impact skeletal muscle growth complicated. Satellite cells
(SC) and their embryonic precursor cells play an in - tegral role in skeletal muscle growth both prenatally and postnatally as they are required for myonuclear accretion. Prenatally skeletal muscle forms from embryonic muscle progenitor cells that are believed to be distinct from SC, but share a common origin
Postnatally, it is generally accepted that SC are important for providing the nuclei necessary for hypertrophy of existing myofibers. However, recent data suggest that skeletal muscle hypertrophy oc - curs in the absence of SC in a rodent model, but whether or not this occurs in livestock is unknown
EFFECTS OF NUTRITION ON SKELETAL
MUSCLE GROWTH
Skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs through protein accretion when the fractional synthesis rate of protein exceeds the fractional breakdown rate
Layman, 2006 ).
A study conducted in neonatal piglets showed that skeletal muscle growth is controlled through both AA and insulin concentrations ( Davis et al.,
EFFECTS OF NUTRITION ON
CIRCULATING GROWTH FACTORS
GH and IGF-1 are directly responsible for controlling growth in both cattle and swine ( Lucy,
GH acts on the liver to increase circulating concen - trations of IGF-1 demonstrating that a strong rela - tionship exists between these two growth factors
(Boyd and Bauman, 1989 ). Circulating IGF-1 from the liver is known to act in an endocrine manner to influence growth and differentiation of tissues such as skeletal muscle and bone ( Boyd and Bauman,
In addition, other growth factors such as IGF-2, epidermal growth factor ( EGF ), fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ), and transforming growth factor beta
(TGF β) are known to impact both skeletal muscle growth and differentiation and proliferation of SC.
This research demonstrates that dietary energy and protein concentrations, as well as the types of feed the energy and protein come from, have an impact on circulating concentrations of GH and IGF-1 in ruminant species.
Blum, 1989 ). The role that nutritional status has on circulating concentrations of IGF-2 is less under - stood. Research demonstrates that steers fed 1% dry matter of the their BW had similar circulating
IGFBP concentrations and the resultant effects of those IGFB on SC activity. Furthermore, as some
IGFBP promote the actions of IGF-1 and others antagonize IGF-1 action, it could be postulated that IGFBP concentrations are going to fluctuate with those of IGF-1 to best maintain the actions of
(Clemmons and Underwood, 1991 ; Brameld, 1997 ;
IGF-1, and TGF β are each known to impact SC, myoblast, and myofiber growth in primary cultured cells of livestock species ( Allen and Boxhorn, 1989 ;
SC cultures with IGF-1 stimulates differentiation, whereas treatment with EGF, FGF, or TGF β inhibits differentiation ( Allen and Boxhorn, 1987 ;
Greene and Allen, 1991 ). GH has been shown to increase protein synthesis rate in bovine skeletal muscle cells without altering mRNA expression of
SC and the resultant skeletal muscle. Additional research is needed to determine specifically how nutrition impacts concentration of both circulating and locally produced growth factors and the effects that these growth factors have on SC growth.
IMPACT OF NUTRITION ON SKELETAL
MUSCLE GROWTH PRENATALLY
Skeletal muscle mass increases through two dif - ferent mechanisms, hyperplasia and hypertrophy.
Early skeletal muscle development can be separated into primary myogenesis and second - ary myogenesis. Primary myofibers form during the first trimester of pregnancy and are followed by formation of secondary myofibers. Secondary myofibers account for the majority of muscle that is formed within an adult mammal. Because mam - mals are born with a set number of muscle fibers that are not capable of hyperplasia, it is likely that
When the maternal plane of nutrition is below maintenance levels, it is hypothesized that the off - spring develop a “thrifty” phenotype, allowing for the animal to survive during instances of low nu - trition ( Neel, 1962 , 1999; Hales and Barker, 1992 ).
However, other research suggests that any effects of inadequate nutrition during the first or second trimesters of gestation can be alleviated as long as adequate levels of nutrition are provided during the third trimester ( Greenwood and Thompson, 2007 ).
Currently, the molecular mechanism(s) through which these changes occur remains unknown. The main pathway that is thought to regulate differen - tiation of mesenchymal stem cells in utero is the
Research analyzing the effects of maternal overnutrition during gestation on skeletal muscle development of the offspring provides conflict - ing results. Feeding ewes at either 20% or 80% above maintenance levels during gestation had no effect on birth or weaning weights of the offspring
IMPACT OF NUTRITION ON SATELLITE
CELLS POSTNATALLY
Postnatal increases in muscle size are due to hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia as muscle fiber number does not significantly increase after birth in livestock species. Although muscle fiber number does not increase postnatally, muscle DNA con - tent continues to increase throughout growth due to SC proliferation, differentiation, and fusion with existing myofibers. As such, SC play an integral role in postnatal growth of skeletal muscle. Recent research in rats suggests that hypertrophy of skel - etal muscle can occur independently of SC, but it is unknown whether this occurs in livestock species
However, more research needs to be conducted in this area to determine how nutrition might impact
SC during postnatal skeletal muscle growth of live - stock species.
Although not much research has been con - ducted in vivo relating nutrition to proliferation and differentiation of SC, a number of in vitro studies have analyzed the effects of how different nutrients may impact SC and myoblast proliferation in cul - ture. A classic example of how nutrition impacts growth of muscle cells in culture can be observed through the practice of reducing serum concen - trations in culture media to induce differentiation.
This indicates that in vitro a lower plane of nutrition promotes differentiation, whereas a higher plane of nutrition promotes proliferation and growth of existing myofibers. When myoblasts are provided with low glucose medium, when compared with high glucose medium, differentiation is increased
Another nutrient that has been shown to alter proliferation and differentiation of SC are fatty acids. In an early report, linoleic acid stimulated differentiation of rat satellite cells ( Allen et al.,
A lack of calcium results in inhibition of muscle cell fusion ( Merlie and Gros, 1976 ; Morris et al.,
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Satellite cells are crucial to skeletal muscle growth during both prenatal and postnatal peri - ods of life. Prenatally, SC are important as they are responsible for initial formation of the myofib - ers. In mammals, the number of myofibers an animal is born with does not change following birth, demonstrating that prenatal development of myofibers is integral in determining postnatal growth potential. During postnatal growth, SC are required for myonuclear accretion, a necessity for skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Nutrient status of growing animals impacts growth of skeletal muscle, which is especially important in livestock animals as it eventually becomes the marketable product, meat. Recently, many studies analyzing the effects of maternal nutrition on growth of skel - etal muscle in livestock have been completed. From these studies, it is apparent that nutrient status of the dam, especially during the second and third trimesters, affects skeletal muscle development of the offspring in utero which can impact lifelong production of those offspring. More research is needed to determine exactly how and when ma - ternal plane of nutrition should be altered during gestation in order to produce offspring with the highest growth potential. In postnatal growth, the impacts of nutrition on SC specifically are cur - rently understudied in livestock species. Nutrient status of an animal is known to impact concen - trations of circulating growth factors, which in turn are known to impacts skeletal muscle growth and SC. The exact mechanism through which this occurs has not been studied. Several early studies in chickens show that nutrient status affects SC and muscle growth, indicating that nutrition plays a large role in this process. A more recent study in dairy calves shows that plane of nutrition im - pacts mitotic index of SC. Furthermore, several studies have been completed using cultured SC models that show different nutrients are able to af - fect SC proliferation and differentiation. However, many of these studies have not been completed in cells from livestock animals. Consequently, add - itional in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to understand how nutrition alters proliferation and differentiation of SC in livestock animals. The in - formation gained from completion of these studies will help in developing diets for livestock animals that optimize growth of skeletal muscle and, ul - timately, production of more meat.
