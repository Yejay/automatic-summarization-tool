Adult humans fail to regenerate their hearts following injury. Failure to regenerate myocardium is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Lower vertebrates such as the newt and zebrafish have an astonishing ability to replace lost cardiac tissue. Understanding why adult mammals develop extensive scarring instead of regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology. We are far from a complete understanding of how heart tissue can regenerate but we are now defining molecular mechanisms that could open the door to stimulating adult mammalian heart regeneration.
