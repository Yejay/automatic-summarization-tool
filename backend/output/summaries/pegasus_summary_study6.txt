the heart is one of the largest organs in the body and is responsible for one - third of the body weight and one - fourth of the body weight of the vertebrates . <n> the heart is the largest blood vessel in the body and is responsible for one - fourth of the body weight and one - fourth of the body weight of the vertebrates . <n> regenerative medicine has the potential to treat a variety of heart diseases . <n> however , the nature of the cells involved in the process of tissue regeneration remains unclear . in this review , <n> we focus on cardiomyocytes , which are the primary cells involved in the process of tissue regeneration . <n> in addition , we also discuss the role of fibroblasts , stem cells , and other cell types in the process of tissue regeneration . <n> we hope that this review will be helpful in understanding the nature of the cells involved in the process of tissue regeneration and will lead to the development of regenerative medicine for heart diseases . <n> we anticipate that this review will be helpful in understanding the nature of the cells involved in the process of tissue regeneration and will provide basic information for the development of regenerative medicine for heart diseases . <n> we hope that
