The impact of nutrition on the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells in livestock species is significant, as discussed in the symposium at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Animal Science. Satellite cells and their embryonic precursors are vital for both prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle growth in mammals. Maternal nutrition changes can affect embryonic muscle progenitor cells, influencing both prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle development. Postnatally, satellite cells are crucial as they support the hypertrophy of existing myofibers, which is the only mechanism for muscle growth after birth since muscle fiber number is fixed at birth. Despite the known effects of nutrition on circulating growth factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and others that impact satellite cell proliferation and activation, there is limited research directly linking nutrition with satellite cell populations in livestock skeletal muscle. However, the relationship among nutrition, growth factors, and satellite cells is a key area for further research, given its potential impact on skeletal muscle growth. Skeletal muscle growth is crucial in the livestock industry as it determines the marketable meat product. Producers aim for livestock that produce more lean meat and less fat to increase production efficiency. Skeletal muscle growth is influenced by factors like nutrition, genetics, and management practices, with protein accretion, myonuclear accretion, and extracellular matrix accrual being critical processes. Satellite cells and their embryonic precursors are essential for myonuclear accretion, with primary and secondary myofibers forming prenatally and satellite cells providing nuclei postnatally for muscle hypertrophy. The nutrient status of an animal significantly impacts skeletal muscle growth. For instance, protein is often discussed in the context of muscle growth, but energy density is also crucial since energy is required for growth. Research on growing beef cattle has shown that body weight (BW) closely parallels protein accretion, and fat accretion is more related to the diet's energy density. Adequate dietary protein or essential amino acids result in increased muscle protein synthesis in healthy humans, but this is less understood in ruminants due to ruminal modification of amino acids. Various nutritional approaches have been studied to increase lean growth, including the amounts of dietary protein and the protein:energy ratio. Amino acids play a role in skeletal muscle growth as they function as cell signaling molecules and regulators of gene expression. For example, leucine regulates protein synthesis by activating the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), increasing protein synthesis rates in skeletal muscle. Arginine supplementation in neonatal piglets increases skeletal muscle through the mTOR pathway, and non-essential amino acids like glutamine also play significant roles in cell growth and differentiation. Nutritional status also impacts circulating growth factors such as growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1, which control growth in cattle and swine. GH regulates metabolic pathways and increases plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. Circulating GH acts on the liver to increase IGF-1, which influences tissue growth and differentiation, including skeletal muscle. Other growth factors like IGF-2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) also impact muscle growth and satellite cell activity. Maternal nutrition during gestation has profound effects on fetal skeletal muscle development, which can impact postnatal growth. Skeletal muscle mass increases through hyperplasia prenatally and hypertrophy both prenatally and postnatally. During gestation, muscle progenitor cells differentiate into myocytes, adipocytes, and fibroblasts, with maternal nutrition affecting their development. Mid-gestation is critical for the development of fat and muscle in the fetus, and skeletal muscle is particularly sensitive to fetal programming effects due to its lower priority compared to organs like the brain and liver. Maternal undernutrition during gestation can lead to a "thrifty" phenotype in offspring, optimizing growth of key organs at the expense of others, affecting postnatal development. Nutrient restriction during the second trimester is particularly critical for skeletal muscle development, but adequate nutrition in the third trimester can alleviate some negative effects. Recent studies show that maternal nutrient restriction during the second or third trimester results in offspring with fewer and smaller myofibers at birth. The molecular mechanisms behind these changes are not fully understood, but pathways like the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are implicated in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Postnatally, satellite cells are crucial for muscle hypertrophy, and their activity can be influenced by nutrition. Early studies in chickens and recent research in dairy calves show that plane of nutrition affects satellite cell activity and muscle growth. For instance, a high plane of nutrition increases muscle fiber cross-sectional area and satellite cell mitotic index in calves. Although there are several in vitro studies on how nutrients affect satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, more in vivo research is needed in livestock species. In summary, satellite cells are essential for skeletal muscle growth both prenatally and postnatally. Nutritional status significantly impacts muscle growth, which is vital in livestock production. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms through which nutrition affects satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle growth, which will help optimize livestock diets for improved meat production.
