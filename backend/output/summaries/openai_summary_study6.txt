The failure of adult humans to regenerate their hearts following injury is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. This inability to regenerate myocardium is observed in all adult mammals, while some vertebrates, like newts and zebrafish, can regenerate heart tissue throughout life. New studies suggest that mammals possess cardiac regeneration potential during development and shortly after birth. The mechanisms of heart regeneration across different model organisms, such as neonatal mice, involve waves of inflammation, matrix deposition, remodeling, and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Understanding why adult mammals develop scarring instead of regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology. Regeneration restores tissue architecture through cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenic rearrangements. Lower vertebrates like newts and zebrafish can replace lost cardiac tissue, but this ability is not seen in adult mammals. In response to cardiac injury, adult mammals, including humans, replace necrotic muscle with scar tissue, leading to compromised contractility and heart failure. Recent data, however, indicate that mammalian cardiogenesis occurs during adult life, including in humans, and that neonatal mice exhibit a regenerative response immediately after birth. Thus, understanding heart tissue regeneration is an exciting therapeutic goal, and identifying molecular mechanisms could stimulate adult heart regeneration. In lower vertebrates, teleost fish like zebrafish can regenerate brain, retina, fins, spinal cord, and heart. Following heart injury, zebrafish do not exhibit the intense collagen deposition and scarring seen in mammalian hearts. Instead, cardiomyocytes proliferate to replace lost tissue, peaking at 14 days post resection, with almost all lost muscle tissue replaced by 60 days. Stem cells are not the source of regenerating myocardium in zebrafish; rather, pre-existing cardiomyocytes dedifferentiate and re-enter the cell cycle. Different injury models, such as genetic ablation and cryoinjury, also show robust myocardial regeneration in zebrafish. Conversely, medaka, another teleost fish, fails to regenerate its heart upon injury, responding with excessive fibrosis. In urodeles like newts and salamanders, the heart can replace lost tissue and function without scarring. Regeneration begins with clot formation, followed by fibrin and collagen deposits, and later cellular proliferation. The newt myocardium downregulates sarcomeric genes during regeneration, supporting the hypothesis that cardiomyocytes undergo partial dedifferentiation. Anurans, such as frogs, show limited heart regeneration, leading to scar tissue formation. The differences in regenerative capacity between anurans and urodeles may be related to differences in their immune systems. In rodents, the fetal mouse heart demonstrates regenerative capacity, with fetal hearts restoring lost cardiomyocyte mass following genetic ablation. Neonatal mice exhibit robust regenerative responses immediately after birth in injury models, including ventricular resection and myocardial infarction. This regenerative response involves rapid clotting, inflammatory cell infiltration, epicardial activation, and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, this capacity declines sharply after birth, with limited regeneration observed in mice injured at post-natal day 7 or day 14. Controversy exists regarding the extent of neonatal heart regeneration. Some studies report extensive scarring and limited regeneration following neonatal ventricular resection, while others demonstrate myocardial regeneration. Factors like injury type and experimental conditions can influence the regenerative response. Studies in zebrafish and neonatal mice indicate that pre-existing cardiomyocytes, rather than stem cells, are the primary source of new cardiomyocytes. The role of c-kit+ cells as cardiac progenitors remains debated, with recent studies suggesting their contribution to cardiomyogenesis is negligible. A major difference between lower vertebrates and mammals is the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete the cell cycle. Mononucleated zebrafish cardiomyocytes can reenter the cell cycle, while many mammalian cardiomyocytes become binucleated shortly after birth. Studies show that Neuregulin1 can induce proliferation of differentiated adult cardiomyocytes, suggesting mononucleated cardiomyocytes may be more receptive to cell cycle reentry. Nerves also play a crucial role in regeneration across multiple species. Studies show that denervation suppresses heart regenerative responses in neonatal mice. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are implicated in cardiac regeneration, suggesting a critical density of nerve factors is necessary for regeneration. Inflammation and immune response are critical regulators of regeneration. Inflammation can either drive or inhibit regeneration. In mice, macrophages are required for cardiac regeneration, and the absence of interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation. Differences in the immune response to myocardial infarction in neonatal and adult mice suggest that immune system maturation affects regenerative capacity. Angiogenesis is vital for regeneration, providing a continuous supply of energy and substrates to regenerating tissue. Factors inducing vascular regeneration can improve tissue renewal and cardiac function in adult mice. Extracellular matrix (ECM) components and epicardial signals also play crucial roles in regeneration, with changes in ECM composition influencing cardiomyocyte proliferation. In summary, the study of heart regeneration in different models reveals evolutionary conserved mechanisms, including immune response, extracellular cues, nerve involvement, and cardiomyocyte division. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to therapies that stimulate heart regeneration in humans, potentially preventing heart failure and improving outcomes for patients with cardiac injuries.
