The study investigated the relationship between health-related physical fitness and daily physical activity (PA) among 265 fifth-grade students. Using FitnessGram tests, the research assessed cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility. Students also maintained a daily PA log for a week, recording activities during physical education (PE) classes, recess, organized sports/dances, and non-organized physical play. Results showed significant associations between physical fitness and PA during PE and recess for girls but not boys. Both boys and girls with higher fitness levels were more active in organized sports/dances and overall weekly PA. Specifically, cardiovascular endurance was a critical factor linked to overall PA, with fit children engaging more in sports/dances and being more active weekly. However, fitness did not significantly correlate with non-organized physical play. The findings underscore the importance of promoting physical fitness to enhance children's PA levels, especially in school settings. The study suggests implementing comprehensive school-based PA programs to improve children's fitness and activity levels. Limitations include reliance on self-reported PA logs and the need for objective PA measures, such as accelerometers, to validate findings further. Future research should explore longitudinal effects and control for potential confounders like socio-economic status and environmental factors. Overall, the study highlights the significant role of physical fitness in fostering active lifestyles among elementary school children, calling for targeted interventions to enhance fitness and PA in this demographic.
