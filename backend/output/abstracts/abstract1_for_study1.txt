Muscle architecture, which includes parameters like fascicle length, pennation angle, and physiological cross-sectional 
area, strongly influences skeletal muscles' mechanical properties. During maturation, the muscle architecture has to adapt 
to a growing organism. This study aimed to develop an architectural model capable of predicting the complete 3D fascicle 
architecture for primarily unipennate muscles of an arbitrary age, based on fascicle data for an initial age. For model develop-
ment, we collected novel data on 3D muscle architecture of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) M. plantaris of eight animals 
ranging in age from 29 to 106 days. Experimental results show that plantaris muscle belly length increases by 73%, whereas 
mean fascicle length and mean pennation angle increases by 39 and 14%, respectively. Those changes were incorporated into 
the model. In addition to the data collected for M. plantaris the predictions of the model were compared to existing literature 
data of rabbit M. soleus and M. gastrocnemius medialis. With an error of −1.0 ± 8.6% for relative differences in aponeurosis 
length, aponeurosis width, muscle height, and muscle mass, the model delivered good results matching interindividual dif-
ferences. For future studies, the model could be utilized to generate realistic architectural data sets for simulation studies.
