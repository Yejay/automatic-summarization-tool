Muscle architecture, encompassing properties such as fascicle length, pennation angle, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), significantly impacts skeletal muscle mechanics. During maturation, these architectural aspects must adapt to the organism's growth. This study aimed to develop a versatile architectural model that predicts the 3D fascicle architecture of primarily unipennate muscles at any age, based on initial fascicle data. The research collected novel data on the 3D muscle architecture of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) M. plantaris from eight animals aged 29 to 106 days. Experimental observations revealed that the plantaris muscle belly length increased by 73%, mean fascicle length by 39%, and mean pennation angle by 14%. These findings were integrated into the model, which was further validated against existing data for rabbit M. soleus and M. gastrocnemius medialis. The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, with a minor error margin of -1.0 ± 8.6% for parameters such as aponeurosis length and width, muscle height, and mass. This model holds potential for generating realistic architectural datasets for future simulation studies. The study begins by emphasizing the influence of muscle architecture on mechanical properties, detailing the importance of parameters like fascicle length, PCSA, pennation angle, and aponeurosis dimensions in determining muscle functionality. Longer fascicles correlate with higher contraction velocities, while shorter fascicles with greater PCSA yield increased force production. The muscle-tendon complex's (MTC) behavior is also influenced by the ratio between muscle belly and free tendon lengths. MTCs with long tendons can store and recover significant elastic energy during movement. During growth, muscles must adjust to increasing bone size and body weight, necessitating changes in muscle architecture to maintain functionality. Despite numerous studies on muscle architecture in humans and animals, few have focused on architectural changes during growth. Previous studies on rabbits indicated that aponeurosis dimensions increase significantly more than fascicle lengths during growth, maintaining a consistent fascicle length distribution. The research presented here developed a 3D geometrical model to predict muscle architecture changes during growth, based on initial fascicle data. The study collected architectural data for the M. plantaris of rabbits at various ages, analyzing muscle belly length, fascicle length, pennation angle, and aponeurosis dimensions. The muscle belly length increased by 73%, while fascicle length and pennation angle increased by 39% and 14% respectively. The model was designed to simulate muscle growth through four geometrical operations: scaling in length and width directions, fascicle lengthening, and fascicle rotation. The experimental methodology involved recording 3D fascicle coordinates from rabbit leg muscles, followed by processing the data to determine muscle architectural parameters. The digitization process provided detailed geometric representations of fascicles, which were then analyzed to derive lengths, pennation angles, and aponeurosis dimensions. The model's input consisted of fascicle coordinates and changes in muscle belly length, width, fascicle length, and pennation angle. The results demonstrated that all architectural parameters increased during growth. The muscle belly length showed a saturation trend, while fascicle length distributions remained consistent across different ages. The model accurately predicted 3D fascicle architectures for older animals, based on initial data from younger specimens. The predicted fascicle length distributions closely matched experimental data, indicating the model's robustness. The model was further validated using data from rabbit M. soleus and M. gastrocnemius medialis. The predictions for these muscles were similarly accurate, with overall model errors of -1.0 ± 8.6%. The research confirmed that the model could reliably simulate muscle architecture changes during maturation for different muscles, suggesting its broad applicability. The discussion highlighted the model's effectiveness in predicting muscle architectural changes, emphasizing that the observed increases in muscle belly length and aponeurosis dimensions necessitate independent scaling in length and width directions. The model's consideration of fascicle lengthening and pennation angle changes further improved prediction accuracy. The findings align with previous studies, reinforcing the model's validity. Functionally, the study noted that the muscle-tendon length ratio increased significantly during growth, enhancing the muscle's ability to store and return elastic energy. This adaptation likely supports increased force production and energy efficiency. The model's accurate predictions of fascicle length distributions also suggest its potential for simulating muscle behavior under various conditions. In conclusion, the study developed a robust architectural model for predicting 3D muscle growth during maturation, validated by experimental data from rabbit muscles. The model's ability to simulate accurate muscle architectures based on initial data and minimal input parameters makes it a valuable tool for future research and clinical applications, facilitating realistic simulations of muscle mechanics and growth.
