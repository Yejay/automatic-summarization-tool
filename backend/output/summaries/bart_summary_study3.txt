The physically fit girls were more physical active in recess than girls who weren't physically fit in the study. The effects of regular PA were found to be more pronounced in children who had a higher level of PA than those who had low levels of PA. These children were more likely to enjoy PA and to maintain their interests in PA as they grew up. They were also likely to have a more active lifestyle as they got older and were more physically active. The study was published by the American College of Physiotherapists (ACP) in 2007. It was the first of its kind and was published on the basis of research on the effects of physical activity on skeletal health.
