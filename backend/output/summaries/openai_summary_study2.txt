This study protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a game-based exercise training program on physical fitness and mental health in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It highlights that children with ASD often exhibit suboptimal physical activity levels, poor motor skills, and poor physical health due to social interaction and communication deficits, which hinder their participation in group physical activities. Previous interventions have shown improvements in motor skills and behavioral outcomes but tend to focus on a single sport, limiting their appeal to different children with ASD. The proposed exercise program was developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts in pediatrics, physical education, and psychology and will be implemented by trained front-line healthcare providers using a train-the-trainer (TTT) model. The study will involve 112 young children with ASD, randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a waitlist control group. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment (16 weeks), and follow-up (32 weeks). The program aims to bridge the gap between mental and physical health by providing a multidimensional training approach that includes aerobic and resistance training, fundamental movement skills, speed, plyometric and agility development. This design aims to strengthen various physical conditions and prevent overuse injuries associated with single-sport training. The program is structured into multiple levels of difficulty to cater to individual needs and promote engagement. Participants aged 4 to 6 years old with a formal diagnosis of ASD, excluding those with congenital abnormalities or other limiting diseases, were recruited through a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The exercise program consists of 32 sessions over 16 weeks, with each session lasting an hour. Children will rotate through six to eight exercise stations designed to train different muscle groups and fitness components. Parents are encouraged to participate in the sessions to support their children. The TTT model involves two 4-hour workshops to train front-line healthcare providers on developmental characteristics, medical issues, training skills, safety concerns, and the details of the exercise program. Trainers will be provided with a manual and visual tools to assist in implementing the program. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated through various physical fitness tests, nonverbal intelligence assessments, socio-emotional skills evaluations, and cognitive-linguistic skills tests. Physical fitness will be assessed using the PREFIT battery, which includes measurements of body weight, height, waist circumference, handgrip strength, standing long jump, 4 x 10 meter shuttle run, one-leg stance test, and overhand throw. Nonverbal intelligence will be measured using the Standard Raven’s Progressive Matrices (SRPM), while socio-emotional skills will be assessed through the Chinese version of the Psychoeducational Profile, Third Edition (CPEP-3), joint attention tasks, and facial emotion recognition tasks. Cognitive-linguistic skills will be evaluated using the Cantonese Oral Language Deficiency Early Identification Test for Pre-primary Children (CEIT), motor automaticity tests, and the Children’s Color Trails Test (CCTT). The study also includes an evaluation of adaptive functioning using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II), which focuses on communication, community use, leisure, self-direction, and social skills. Children’s adherence to the training program will be monitored through attendance rates and session performance records. Coaching efficacy of the trainers will be assessed using an 8-item adherence score, and parents will evaluate their children’s global functioning improvement using the Clinical Global Impression scale on Improvement (CGI-I). Sample size calculation indicated that 112 children are needed to detect significant differences with 80% power. Data analysis will involve repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and mixed models to assess within-subject and between-subject effects. Multiple imputations will be used for missing data, and the results will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This study aims to provide comprehensive support for children with ASD through a multidimensional, game-based exercise program. If effective, it could serve as an intervention strategy to improve physical fitness, psychological well-being, and life skills necessary for engaging in sports and leisure activities. The implementation by front-line healthcare providers ensures the program's sustainability in the community.
