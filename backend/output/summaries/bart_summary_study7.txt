Skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs through protein accretion. Protein accretion occurs when the fractional synthesis rate of protein exceeds the fractionsal breakdown rate. Energy density of the diet is also an important factor as energy is required for growth. The focus is on how nutrients are more important for skeletal musclegrowth in beef cows than in other livestock species such as sheep or goats. The aim is to identify the nutrients that are most significant for skeletal Muscle Growth in Beef Cattle.
