The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing globally, and Hong Kong is of no exception. ASD is characterised by a number of neurodevelopmental-based impairments, including social interaction and communi- cation deficits, repetitive and stereotypical behaviours and interests. Previous studies have demonstrated that exercise intervention improves motor skills and behavioral outcomes in children with ASD. The present game-based exercise program was developed to equip ASD children with the necessary skills for engaging in sustainable team sports or even professional sport training. The program, if effective, will provide an entertaining and engaging training for whole-person development among children with autism spectrum disorder.

Other exercise items include horseback riding, martial arts, resistance training, yoga and dance [ 12,13]. To encourage children with ASD to engage in physical activity, the intervention should be followed up with a follow-up visit. The intervention should also be followed-up with a visit to the hospital to ensure that the children are receiving the appropriate care. The goal is to encourage children to engage with physical activity. The treatment should be monitored for a year and a half after the intervention to ensure the children continue to have physical activity in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The therapy should be completed by the end of the third year of the treatment.
