The study explores the relationship between quality of life and physical fitness in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI), who often suffer from higher mortality and morbidity rates due to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. These conditions can negatively impact their quality of life, and physical fitness is proposed as a significant modifiable factor that could improve their well-being. The researchers aimed to determine how physical fitness contributes to the quality of life in people with SMI. The study involved assessing 62 participants with SMI using 11 fitness tests that measured flexibility, strength, balance, and endurance. Quality of life was evaluated using the EQ-5D-3L scale, which covers five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain-discomfort, and anxiety-depression. The results indicated significant correlations between quality of life and key physical fitness variables such as balance, endurance, and upper limb strength. Specifically, endurance accounted for 22.9% of the variance in quality of life, and functional reach added another 36.2% variance, suggesting that these physical fitness components play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for people with SMI. The study's findings highlight the importance of improving physical fitness in this population to enhance their overall well-being. Despite the higher prevalence of physical disorders among individuals with SMI, such as infections, metabolic disorders, respiratory issues, and cardiovascular diseases, the study suggests that targeted interventions to improve physical fitness could mitigate some of these adverse health outcomes and improve quality of life. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Research of Málaga Northeast and included participants from the Mental Health Service of the Regional University Hospital of Málaga. Participants were between 26 and 61 years old, and those with comorbid substance abuse or severe physical disorders were excluded. The study employed a cross-sectional design, collecting sociodemographic variables through semi-structured interviews and anthropometric measurements following the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry standards. Physical fitness was assessed using tests such as passive knee extension, calf muscle flexibility, anterior hip flexibility, functional shoulder rotation, timed-stand test, partial sit-up test, seated push-up test, grip test, single-leg stance (open and closed eyes), functional reach test, and the two-minute step test. The quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D-3L scale, including a visual analogue scale (VAS) for global health status assessment. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and correlation analyses, with a linear regression analysis to assess the contribution of physical fitness to quality of life. The results revealed that the participants had a mean age of 45.69 years, mean weight of 81.26 kilograms, mean height of 165 centimeters, and a body mass index of 30.63. Significant correlations were found between quality of life and balance, endurance, and upper limb strength, suggesting that these physical fitness variables significantly contribute to the quality of life in people with SMI. The regression analysis indicated that physical fitness variables could explain up to 49% of the variance in quality of life, with dynamic balance and endurance being the most significant predictors. The study's findings underscore the need for interventions aimed at improving physical fitness in people with SMI to enhance their quality of life. The researchers acknowledge certain limitations, such as the cross-sectional design, small sample size, and the use of a generic quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), which may not capture subtle changes in the specific population of schizophrenia patients. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the importance of physical fitness in improving the quality of life for individuals with SMI. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and include larger, more diverse samples to generalize the findings. Additionally, more consensus on the concept and measures of quality of life in patients with schizophrenia is needed to facilitate comparisons across studies. The study concludes that improving physical fitness, particularly balance and endurance, should be a key objective in interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life in people with SMI. Encouraging physical activity is crucial for this population, as it plays a significant role in improving physical fitness and, consequently, their overall quality of life. Programs focused on enhancing physical health through targeted interventions could have a profound impact on the well-being of individuals with severe mental illness.
