The systematic review examined the efficacy of school-based intervention programs aimed at preventing obesity and promoting physical activity (PA) and physical fitness (PF) among children. The study employed a PRISMA-based approach, screening three databases between 2010 and 2019, and included interventions in primary and secondary schools that measured variables related to obesity, PA, or PF. Out of 395 potential studies, 19 met the eligibility criteria, with most showing significant improvements in at least one outcome. The review found that physical activity-oriented programs had higher success rates in all measured variables compared to those focusing on education, guidance, or other support methods. Physical activity (PA) is crucial for preventing cardiovascular and mental illnesses and improving physical fitness (PF). Regular PA reduces risks for diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, while inactivity increases these risks. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily for children and adolescents. Despite the importance, PA levels have declined due to technological advancements, leading to decreased PF among children. Schools, where children spend a significant portion of their day, are critical for providing PA opportunities, yet the scope and quality of physical education vary widely. Schools are ideal settings for promoting PA because they can integrate it into the curriculum and teach lifelong PA habits. Research indicates that school-based PA interventions can significantly impact obesity prevention, PA promotion, and PF. These interventions include physical education curriculum changes, classroom activity breaks, active commuting, modified playgrounds, and comprehensive multi-component programs. Despite the critical role of schools, PA levels in children remain inadequate, and obesity rates are rising. Overweight and obesity are complex issues influenced by dietary intake, PA, sedentary behavior, family characteristics, and school policies. School-based interventions should be comprehensive and multi-component, focusing on increasing PA and promoting healthy behaviors. The review found that interventions focusing on PA were more successful in improving obesity-related parameters, PA levels, and PF. Studies measuring BMI, waist circumference, skinfold, and body fat percentage showed significant improvements in about half of the cases. PA levels increased significantly in a substantial number of studies, especially those with direct PA interventions. For PF, most studies showed significant improvements in aerobic endurance and other health-related fitness components. The review highlighted the importance of structuring school-based interventions to focus on PA and incorporating comprehensive, multi-component programs for long-term health benefits. The study also identified several limitations, such as excluding non-English publications and focusing only on physiological dimensions related to obesity, PA, and PF. Future research should consider variables like curriculum, teaching models, and teacher competencies related to PA and PF development. The main goal of school-based PA programs should be to develop motor skills necessary for lifelong activity and educate children on positive social behaviors while improving their PA and fitness levels. Collaboration between physical education teachers, health professionals, and sports scientists is essential for designing effective intervention programs. In conclusion, school-based interventions have significant potential for preventing obesity and promoting PA and PF among children. Programs should focus on direct PA interventions, be comprehensive, and involve collaboration between various stakeholders to ensure long-term success. Future research should address the holistic understanding of PA habits, including knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and consider the role of physical literacy in improving children's health.
