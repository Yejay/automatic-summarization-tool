Adult humans fail to regenerate their hearts following injury, and this failure to regenerate 
myocardium is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Although all adult mammals 
appear to lack significant cardiac regeneration potential, some vertebrates can regenerate 
myocardium throughout life. In addition, new studies indicate that mammals have cardiac 
regeneration potential during development and very soon after birth. The mechanisms of heart 
regeneration among model organisms, including neonatal mice, appear remarkably similar. 
Orchestrated waves of inflammation, matrix deposition and remodeling, and cardiomyocyte 
proliferation are commonly seen in heart regeneration models. Understanding why adult mammals 
develop extensive scarring instead of regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology.
