Nutrition  and  other  external  fac-
tors are known to have a marked effect on growth 
of   skeletal  muscle,  modulated,  at  least  in  part,  
through effects on satellite cells. Satellite cells and 
their embryonic precursors play an integral role 
in  both  prenatal  and  postnatal  skeletal  muscle  
growth  of   mammals.  Changes  in  maternal  nu-
trition can impact embryonic muscle progenitor 
cells which ultimately impacts both prenatal and 
postnatal skeletal muscle development. Satellite 
cells  are  important  in  postnatal  skeletal  muscle  
growth  as  they  support  the  hypertrophy  of   ex-
isting myofibers. Hypertrophy of  existing fi-
bers is the only mechanism of  postnatal muscle 
growth  because  muscle  fiber  number  is  fixed  at  
birth  and  fiber  nuclei  have  exited  the  cell  cycle.  
Because fiber nuclei do not divide, additional nu-
clei  required  for  hypertrophy  must  be  acquired  
from  satellite  cells.  To  date,  little  research  has  
aimed at determining whether nutrition directly 
impacts satellite cell populations within skeletal 
muscle  of   livestock  species.  However,  it  is  well  
established that nutrition alters circulating con-
centrations  of   various  growth  factors  such  as  
insulin-like  growth  factor  1,  epidermal  growth  
factor,  hepatocyte  growth  factor,  and  fibroblast  
growth  factor.  Each  of   these  different  growth  
factors impacts satellite cell proliferation and/or 
activation,  indicating  that  nutrition  likely  plays  
a  large  role  in  skeletal  muscle  growth  through  
impacting  the  satellite  cell  pool  in  both  pre-
natal  and  postnatal  growth.  The  relationship  
among  nutrition,  growth  factors,  and  satellite  
cells relative to skeletal muscle growth is an im-
portant  area  of   research  that  warrants  further  
consideration.
