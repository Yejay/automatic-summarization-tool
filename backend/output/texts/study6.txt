Abstract
Adult humans fail to regenerate their hearts following injury, and this failure to regenerate myocardium is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Although all adult mammals appear to lack significant cardiac regeneration potential, some vertebrates can regenerate myocardium throughout life. In addition, new studies indicate that mammals have cardiac regeneration potential during development and very soon after birth. The mechanisms of heart regeneration among model organisms, including neonatal mice, appear remarkably similar.
Orchestrated waves of inflammation, matrix deposition and remodeling, and cardiomyocyte proliferation are commonly seen in heart regeneration models. Understanding why adult mammals develop extensive scarring instead of regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology.

Anurans
Anurans are an order of Amphibians distinct from urodeles and includes toads and frogs. In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the Soviet scientist Rumyantsev characterized cellular proliferation and ultrastructure of muscle fibers following heart injury in adult frogs
(Rumjancev and Carlson, 1991 ; Rumyantsev, 1973 ). Adult anuran cardiomyocytes are capable of DNA synthesis, cellular proliferation and dedifferentiation to some extent, but Uygur and Lee Page 3

There is a remarkable difference in the regenerative capacity of the heart in anuran and urodele species of Amphibia. Anurans lose their overall regenerative capacity progressively as they go through metamorphisis from the larvae stage to the adult, concominant with maturation of the immune system ( Izutsu and Yoshizato, 1993 ; Rollins-Smith, 1998 ).
Urodeles, which have strikingly different immune systems compared to anurans, also go through metamorphosis, but their immune system is more stable ( Godwin and Rosenthal,
Heart Regeneration in Rodents
Cardiac regeneration in the fetal mouse heart
Cardiac regeneration in neonatal mammals
Adult mammalian hearts fail to show significant regenerative capacity in different injury models ( Kikuchi and Poss, 2012 ; Rumyantsev, 1977 ), but the possibility of a regenerative window in children has been proposed for almost a century in analyses of post-mortem histological specimens ( Macmahon, 1937 ; Warthin, 1924 ). These studies inspired Robledo to explore cardiac regeneration in young rats in the 1950s, but he observed only incomplete regeneration following a myocardial burn injury in rats day 4-7 after birth (Robledo, 1956).
Recently, direct experimental evidence for a robust regenerative capacity in neonates has been reported in mice in a range of injury models including ventricular resection ( Porrello et Uygur and Lee Page 4

The curious role of nerves
Over the last century, studies across multiple species has shown that nerves are indispensible for regeneration in many organs. Classical experiments in newt limbs show that denervated limbs cannot regenerate ( Todd, 1823 ). Newt and salamander lens, retina and tail are other systems where adequate number of nerve fibres are required to guide regeneration To date, several nerve-derived factors have been shown to function in regeneration, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in vertebrate limb regeneration( Gospodarowicz and

Inflammatory and immune response in heart regeneration
Unlike embryonic development, tissue growth in regeneration is initiated by an injury, and the inflammatory response to that injury is a critical regulator of the regenerative process.
Inflammation can drive regeneration but can also inhibit it under some circumstances.
Xenopus  limbs. As young Xenopus  larvae transition into adulthood through metamorphosis, their immune system also passes through gradual maturation; concominantly, they lose their regenerative capacity ( Godwin and Rosenthal, 2014 ). Grow et al. performed gene expression analysis comparing earlier stage regeneration-competent xenopus limbs and later stage regeneration-incompetent xenopus limbs and reported a higher level of pro-inflammatory genes expression 1 day post amputation in the regeneration incompetent limbs ( Grow et al.,
Together, the studies in frogs and salamanders show that the early inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the intiation of regenerative processes.
Interestingly, macrophage depletion did not influence cardiomyocyte proliferation following infarction. The molecular profiling of macrophages suggested that secretion of pro- angiogenic cytokines may be responsible for their important role in cardiac regeneration

Development vs. Regeneration in the heart
Transcriptional profile of cardiomyocytes in development and regeneration
A common principle observed in tissue regeneration is the reactivation of the previously employed developmental transcriptional programs. Studies in different model organisms have shown that mechanisms in developmental cardiogenesis also govern morphological regeneration of the injured heart. As discussed previously, in lower vertebrates and Uygur and Lee Page 10

Conclusion
New research in heart regeneration in different experimental models is revealing that many molecular mechanisms may be shared by organisms that are able to regenerate their hearts.
These mechanisms include stimulation of an essential immune response, regulation by extracellular cues, a role for nerves and a critical contribution for cardiomyocyte division.
We still do not understand the barriers to heart regeneration that lead to extensive scarring and eventual heart failure in humans who have major cardiac injuries. The imperative for the field is to learn from the developmental biology of the heart and define the regenerative pathways. Currently, after blood flow is restored in heart attack patients, we largely watch and see how extensive the injury become. In this critical time window, there is an opportunity to identify which patients may develop heart failure in the future and treat them with a regenerative therapy. Should we deliver exogenous cells to replace the lost cardiomyocytes, or can we activate endogenous regeneration pathways at just the right moment?

Figure 1. Cardiac Regeneration Across Model Organisms
Cardiac regeneration has been studied in a number of model systems. While lower vertebrate model species like teleost fish and urodeles retain regenerative capacity throughout adult life, anurans and mammals lose this ability in adulthood. It should be noted that not all teleost fish have been reported to have complete regenerative response upon heart injury. Future studies on different species and different injury types will broaden our understanding of evolutionary conservation of capacity for cardiac regeneration.Uygur and Lee Page 23

Figure 2. Mammalian response to injury
Cardiac regeneration has been explored in fetal, neonatal and adult mammals and occurs to a different extent in each model. At embryonic stages, compensatory growth in cardiomyocytes restores up to 50% of lost tissue. In the neonatal mouse, tissue can replace a majority of lost cardiomyocytes with minimal scarring in myocardial infarction and ventricular resection models. In the adult mouse, cardiomyocyte proliferation is insufficient to replace lost tissue, and extracellular matrix deposition following injury leads to extensive scarring.Uygur and Lee Page 24

Figure 3. Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of cardiac regeneration
Cardiomyocyte proliferation is central to the process of cardiac regeneration, and several processes have been shown to modulate proliferation upon injury in a range of organisms that are capable of a complete regenerative response. An inflammatory response tightly regulates a fine balance between proliferation and repair. Extracellular matrix deposition following injury creates a permissive environment for cellular proliferation and is influenced by signals from the epicardium following injury. Neoangiogenesis is triggered by FGF and
PDGF signaling and provides a supply of oxygen and nutrients to the regrowing tissue, and new studies emphasize the requirement of nerves in the regenerate.Uygur and Lee Page 25
